# Basic concepts

# 3.2: How many seconds are in a month (30 days)?
# Seconds in an hour = 60 * 60, hours in day = 24 days in month = 30
print(30 * 24 * 60 * 60)

# 5.2: A bacteria culture starts with 500 bacteria and doubles in size every hour, calculate the output after 24 hours
# Stating value * 2^number of cycles
print(500 * 2 ** 24)

# 6.2: What's the number of hours and minutes in 888 minutes?
# Hours - floor division is // which gives you the quotient,
print(888 // 60)
# Minutes - modulo operator is % which gives remainders
print(888 % 60)

# 8: Code Project - Calculate the flight time from LA to Sydney, covering a distance of 7425 miles at 550/mph (answer is a float)
print(7425 / 550)
